# RAG-Chat: RAG using Knowledge Graphs and OpenAI

Retrieval Augmented Generation for QA using Knowledge Graphs is a strategic initiative aimed at elevating the question-answering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT. This endeavor stems from the acknowledgment of inherent limitations faced by LLMs when responding to queries about unfamiliar or highly specific documents. The proposed solution involves the integration of a sophisticated retrieval system with knowledge graphs to provide contextually rich information, addressing the identified limitations. This project has been integrated with React and Python, leveraging NLP with Large Language Models (LLMs)
